# EMG and grip strenght timer

## Project Overview

This application is made for a Lab in Physiological Measurements and Sensors -course in Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. The aim of the lab is to replicate the study by Mahadi et al. (2021), titled *Electromyography (EMG) and Hand Gripping Force During Standing and Sitting*, published in IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering. The aim is to analyze muscle activation and grip strength under different postural conditions (standing and sitting) using electromyography (EMG).

## Program Description

The `main.py` program is designed to control the various stages of the research experiment. It automates the timing of each phase, ensuring consistency and accuracy during data collection.

### Key phases
#### baseline muscle tone
To measure muscle tone (EMG) the participant is instructed to stay still for 10 seconds

#### Squeeze 
To measure grip strenght the participant is instructed to squeeze for 5 seconds

#### Short rest 
The participant is instructed to rest between squeezes
